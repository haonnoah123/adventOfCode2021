# adventOfCode2021
* While taking AP CSA during the month of december we would be assigned different days from Advent of Code. The days got progressively harder and really helped improve my problem solving skills. It was very helpful to be around people who were struggling with the same thing, which also helped my skills with co-developing with others.
